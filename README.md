Hi there! My name is Vitor and I specialize in backend development with experience in full-stack as well. I mostly study on my own.


When I'm not busy exploring the depths of code, you can usually find me researching games and writing some top-notch Rust code (or at least trying my best to do so). 


Also an unskillful FIFA 23 player and vocaloid degen.
